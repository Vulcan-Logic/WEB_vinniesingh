    `<p> Computer programming has been one of my pastimes for many years. Starting with writing
        GW-BASIC programs on DOS for an Intel-8088, I have programmed in many packages and languages.
        COBOL, SQL, C, Java, R, EXCEL, LABVIEW, MATLAB, Python and JavaScript being some of the 
        them. 
    </p>                                        
    <p> Apart from programming for personal interest, I have used my software & programming skills                                         
        in profession too. Working in the family business, I programmed & customised MS-Office                                         
        products to increase efficiency and I made a small application                                         
        (using JAVA (SWING, JDBC) & PostgreSQL) for inventory management.                                        
        At my last role as a Purchasing Officer in Sydney, I used MS-EXCEL 
        to digitise the inventory, collect & analyze data to arrive at estimate for error in cost                                          
        estimates.

    <p>Being trained in using AUTOCAD at University, I started using it for                                          
        making and managing drawings for our business. After being introduced to 3D modelling,                                          
        I switched first to Pro-Engineer and then to CATIA. I made quite a few 3D models and                                          
        drawings for use in technical development and manufacturing processes. 
    </p>                                          
    <p> A constant learner, I have attended online courses in Information Technologies and I have 
        a few certificates from providers like Coursera.

    <p> Out of an interest for maths & statistics, I turned to data science which led me to                                         
    the Data Science Specialization programme conducted by John Hopkins University and 
    Coursera.                                        
    This gave me skills in R programming and I practised in using R for analysis and document                                        
    & web-app creation. Data Science is incomplete without machine and deep learning,                                         
    reading for which gave me more practice in Python, which is now my preffered language. 
    </p>             
    <p> More recently, I was accepted into the Junior Web Development programme conducted by                                          
        Academy Xi and Generation Australia. This programme has been extremely beneficial for me.                                        
        Apart from improving my HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Agile skills,                                          
        I have worked upon important behavioural and soft skills like                                          
        communication, collaboration and adaptability. 
    </p>
    <p>  My current skill sets include writing code in: <strong> HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6, SQL, Python & R </strong>. 
    I have used libraries and frameworks like <strong> REACT.js, REACT-Redux, Bootstrap 4, Node.js & Flask. </strong> 
    I use git and GitHub extensively for storing, sharing and collaborating on code. I am comfortable in using relational 
    databases like Oracle and PostgreSQL. I can repair and reload Windows & Linux on physical and virtual machines
    (cloud computing). </p>                                         
    <p> Enjoying the benefits of a basic software engineering education, I know about systems                                          
        analysis & design methodologies including OOAD. <strong> Familiar with agile software development

            the two different skill sets that I have been pursuing: <strong> Full stack 
            web application development and data science software development. </strong>    
            <br/>Some of the projects were on freelance basis and I gained valuable 
            experience in implementing them. Other projects/tasks listed

            I started on the current website to make it as a simple single page 
            web-app to highlight the profile and portfolio.

            I used HTML 5, 
            CSS 3, Bootstrap 4 classes to layout the

            shadow and text effects.

            All web-pages that I make are responsive and I try to 
            make sure that they display reasonable well on all devices. I use 
            CSS on specific classes to achieve this goal. 
            <br />
            I used vanilla JavaScript to enable activation of menu links and 
            for smooth scrolling and proper margins on different devices. I 
            also used JavaScript to implement a scroll spy effect to update
            the links in the menu bar as the content is manually scrolled.`,

            project was a single page app for the same client who changed 
            their mind and wanted a multi-page app. <br/>
            I used HTML 5, CSS 3, Bootstrap 4 classes to layout the 
            design for the first page. I modified the CSS of various 
            classes for customisation and to make the design responsive. 
            After making sure the first page laid 
            out well on different devices, I used this as a template and made
            two other pages. 
            <br/>
            For two other pages, I used the template to layout the mast head,
            the navigation bar and the content area. These two 
            (services/security equipment) pages, 
            use JavaScript and data stored in a file to dynamically render 
            the content. 
            The content is laid out in cards dynamically 
            generated by JavaScript and added to the DOM so that they can be 
            rendered by the browser.
            <br/>
            These two pages also display a modal window that has content 
            specific to the card that was clicked on that page. The 
            content of the modal is also loaded dynamically by JavaScript. 
            JavaScript is used to dynamically modify the styles of the 
            classes for responsiveness. The modal displays 
            differently on different device types as images and the layout 
            changes depending upon the device and orientation.

            aspect of their business.

            This was the third single page site that I made using HTML 5,

            <br/>
            Though I was already familiar with HTML, CSS & JS, this course 
            helped me in many ways. It was a welcome refresher in good coding 
            practices, persistence, adaptability, communication and knowledge 
            (HTML5, CSS3, JS-ES6, Data Structures and algorithms). 
            <br/>
            I learnt about wire-frame designs and agile methodologies in this 
            programme. It was also a great opportunity to work in a 
            formal corporate-like environment which required me to  
            communicate, 
            co-operate, share, collaborate and work with course mates. 
            I helped other course mates and in turn I also got to 
            teach and learn new things. 
            <br />
            The course also got me to use git and git-hub regularly 
            which I had used off and on in the past but not in 
            a regular fashion. Working with others in resolving merge issues
            in git was a great learning experience.

            In technical terms, the site is a simple multi-page site that 
            uses HTML 5 CSS3, Bootstrap 4 classes and JS-ES6. I did learn
