                            <p> With a keen interest in computer programming, I started programming in 1988 and it has been a hobby 
                                ever since. The very first programs I wrote were written for a GW-BASIC interpreter running on an 
                                Intel-8088 PC. </p>
                            <p> Following my hobby, over the next few years, I learnt to programme in COBOL, dBase III+, VP Planner, 
                                Lotus 123, Oracle SQL + PL/SQL and C. My mathematics degree required me to learn PASCAL while yet 
                                another educational endeavour required me to learn MATLAB. </p>
                            <p> While working for my family business, I wrote small programmes in MS-ACCESS & MS-EXCEL to improve 
                                business functions and I used JAVA (SWING, JDBC) & PostgreSQL to wrtie a small application for 
                                inventory management. </p>
                            <p> I also developed an interest in using AUTOCAD for making and managing drawings for the business. 
                                I moved from AUTOCAD to Pro-Engineer to make 3D models, finally working with CATIA to make hundreds of 
                                3D models and drawings. Demonstrations by National Instruments in LABVIEW got me interested in that 
                                side of technology and I attended training courses for LABVIEW. Unfortunately, I have not been able to 
                                use LABVIEW for a project so far. </p>
                            <p> Having studied statistics, I developed an interest in data science which led me to the Data Science 
                                specialization programme conducted by John Hopkins University and Coursera. 
                                This gave me skills in R programming and using markdown for active documents. 
                                Data Science is incomplete without machine and deep learning, reading for which introduced me to 
                                Python, a programming language I have come to appreciate and admire. </p>
                            <p> I was accepted into the Junior Web Development programme coducted by Academy Xi and Generation 
                                Australia. This programme has been extremely beneficial for me. Apart from increasing my HTML5, CSS3, 
                                JavaScript and Agile skills, I have improved upon important behaviourial and soft skills like 
                                Communication, Collaboration, Adapatability and Personal Responsibility.
                            <p> A constant learner, I like doing online courses to increase my knowledge and I have many other 
                                certificates realted to programming (Flask, Node.js, React.js) from Udacity & Coursera.
                            <p> While I have been writing computer programs as a hobby for many years, 
                                it was only recently that I decided to become a fulltime software developer. With knowledge of all 
                                components in all layers of the software technology stack (browser/middleware/databases) required for 
                                complete web applications, I can write full stack web applications.</p>
                            <p> With some software engineering knowledge, I am familiar with Agile development methedologies and 
                                concepts like OOAD, MVC, MVVC etc.
